#	BIG FAT NOTE:
#
#	This directory is dedicated to Intel-x86 Architecture.
#	I know that x86 is only architecture Sandix support, and it is not
#	necessary to seperate architecture dependent/independent header files.
#	But we are not just building a runnable system, we are learning how to
#	build a portable, runnable system. Therefore, in spite of the
#	complexity, i choose to make such a architecture-dependent header file
#	subdirectory, just like what Linux do.
