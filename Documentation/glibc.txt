Today i'm reading manuls about
GNU C Library(glibc), glib, Gnulib, GCC, gnu-c-manul.

I was confused about ISO C, POSIX and glibc, that i couldn't figure out what's
the difference between them. After reading the manuls, i know that, ISO C and
POSIX are standard specifications which define the way people use C and how
the functions was used. There are other standards like BSD, SunOS and so on.

However, glibc(or glib) is an specific implementation of ISO C and POSIX.
It's a Standard C Library which every programmer uses everyday.

Gnulib is funny. 
Why GNU not modify glibc to make it portable instead of creating Gnulib?

Need_to_Learn: libtool, link, library...all this concepts.
