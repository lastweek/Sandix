Copy various drivers from Linux Kernel.
I don't have a good understanding of "What is Driver". There are some code that
should not be drivers in my opinion, but actually are drivers in Linux kernel.

The Kconfig file in each directory has a detailed description about each module.
Linux supports colossal amount of hardware and platform, therefore there are too
many unnecessary modules for me.

Read driver code can help me get a better understanding of Hardware and the difference
between different platforms.

I'm going to commence with TTY.
