			Sandix kernel project

WHAT IS SANDIX?

	-Sandix is a clone of the operating system Unix, written based
	 on Linux kernel. Sandix is the abbreviation for Sandy Unix.

WHAT IS THE DEVELOPMENT PLAN?

	-The contributor is a graduate student who can code Sandix only
	 in his spare time. There is not a accurate schedule for Sandix
	 development, but i do hope Sandix can have a robust body after
	 about 6 months.

WHY CODING SANDIX?

	 :)
	 It's personal interest.
	 It's fun.
	 It's cool.
