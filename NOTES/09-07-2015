# Keyword: FHS, Root Filesystem

FHS(Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) specifies a standard filesystem hierarchy
for FHS filesystems by specifying the location of files and directories, and
the contents of some system files.

This standard has been designed to be used by system integrators, package
developers, and system administrators in the construction and maintenance of
FHS compliant filesystems. It is primarily intended to be a reference and is
not a tutorial on how to manage a conforming filesystem hierarchy.

If you want to build a Linux Distribution like CentOS or Ubuntu, you mainly
need such things:
	Boot Loader (GRUB2, LILO...)
	Linux Kernel Image,
	Root Filesystem,
	Misc Librarys,
	Standard C Library (Glibc, ulibc...),
	Utilities (Busybox, cat, ls...),
	Host-specific Config Files (under /etc)...

Once you prepared all such things described above(it is not easy), you can
begin to build the Distribution as follow steps:
	Configure the kernel source,
	Build the kernel image,
	Partition the storage follow FHS (Hard Disk or USB Stick),
	Put everything described above the root filesystem,
	Make sure boot loader and kernel image are ready,
	Enjoy!

Yes, it seems easy right? Sorry but to build a runnable Linux Distribution from
scratch is very complex and time-comsuing! The idea and the steps are simple,
but the process to success is hard to walk!
