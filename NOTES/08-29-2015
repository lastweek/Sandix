# Keywork: [BOOK] Modern Embedded System

Hello, it is BOOK day!

One week at home, and i finished the textbook: Modern Embedded System! It is
quite exciting to finish it in 7 days. After reading, i gained a mature thought
about Embedded Hardware and Software. About Embedded Hardware: Embedded system
is composed of various hardware components. What hardware components avaliable
depending on your choice. Traditional components are: CPU(Intel Atom, Atmel,
ARM, SPARK...), Network(Ethernet Adapter, Wireless Adapter, Bluetooth...),
Graphics(GPU, Hardware-Accelerated Encode, Hardware-Accelerated Decode...),
Timers(Integrated, HPET...), Watchdog(Intel WTD...) and other various PCIe
based devices. Next, Embedded Software: Linux. Yes, we have no other choice.
Embedded Linux is the best software in embedded system. Linux has so many
device drivers for various different class devices.

Yes, i have some future plans:
<1> Learn how to build a Linux Distribution.
<2> Read more books on embedded area.
<3> Coding to learn.
