Power Management Day. ;)

Finally, clear the ACPI stone! What is the contribution of ACPI? ACPI offers an
platform-independent, device-independent power management interface. ACPI
defines several states: Global State-Gx, Sleeping State-Sx, CPU State-Cx,
Performance State-Px, Device State-Dx. Having these definitions, OEM and vendor
can implement internal power states along with ACPI defined interface that OS
can manipulate.

For ALWAYS Intel example! Most Intel CPU Datasheets depict there implementation
about ACPI states. Generally, CPU execute at C0. CPU enters C1 or C2 or C3 when
encounter HLT or MWAIT or legacy ACPI-Register I/O Read/Write. Of course, CPU
can back to C0 when some events happen.

That is all for now. Learn ACPI from ACPI Specification and Linux ACPI source.
