# Keyword: Driver, Device, IRQ, Interrupt

Things are getting clear.

Yes, device drivers play a very crucial role in operating system. And figure
out how drivers drive devices is important. One device driver should have such
functions: device_probe(), device_init(), device_ops(), device_irq(), etc.
Also, one driver can drive multiple devices. System should provide such API:
driver_register(), driver_unregister(). Also, its system's job to relate driver
to device.

Device Drivers like PCI drivers have to deal with relocateable device and
shared interrupt line.

Some systems may not guarantee that data is delivered to main memory before
interrupts are delivered to the CPU. Drivers must handle this properly.

For now i have one vga console driver now. The driver treat one screen as a
device. And one driver can drive multiple screens.

Remember, idea and design are the most important thing.
