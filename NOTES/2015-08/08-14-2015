Actually, there are no 8253, 8259 or other legacy chips in motherboard anymore.
There corresponding functions are integrated into PCH chipset. For legacy
support, Intel PCH remains the I/O ports these chips used to use. That is why
we can still manipulate these chips through I/O ports even though there are no
such chips on the motherboard.

Hence, Sandix must have a beautiful and useful driver layer to support various
different "IO hardware". Linux has done a good job, just learn.
