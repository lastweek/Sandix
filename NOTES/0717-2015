Have read POSIX Spec V4.
See how POSIX defines various C programming API and other OS specification.
POSIX is just like OpenMP, they are both SPECIFICATION which define the
_interface_ that programmers can follow and implementation must apply.

It is _not_ a good one to be consulted when you have programming problems.
It is only a specification, a definition.
