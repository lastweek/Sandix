Core ix is different from Xeon in design principle.
Core i3 processor has three Display Interface(which can be configured as HDMI,
DVI, DP), but Xeon processors do not have any graphic engine.
That is because Core is dedicated for Desktop which need visual display. At the
oppsite, Xeon is dedicated for Server which need more calculation than display.

VGA is supported by PCH. Processor has Flexible Display Interface connected to
PCH. It can seen as followes: The display data from the frame buffer is
processed in the display engine of the processor and sent to the PCH over the
FDI where it is transcoded as per the display protocol and driven through the
DAC to the analog display monitor.

It seems quite weird to support VGA. And the industry seems want to drop VGA,
instead, they prefer DVI, HDMI, DP. As a sequence, the 6 Gen Core Processor do
not have FDI interface, and corresponding chipset Z170 does not support VGA
output anymore! Which means current Sandix can not even have graphic output in
6 Gen platform.

Signal layout in LGA 1150 is described in datasheet-vol-1, we can see how these
signals are spreaded in such a small chip. Also i have downloaded a LGA 1150
specification from Intel.com which has a descriptive portray about 1150.

Last but not least! Let us talk about PCH(Platform Controller Hub)! Before met
this guy, the misc controllers and IO port are still mysteries to me. But now,
after i have known about the components of PCH, the functions of PCH, the
interfaces of PCH, i have a better top view of how things work! I can not
descript everything in PCH, so if you or future me want to learn the details,
please refer to any Intel Chipset Datasheet(e.g. 8-series, 9-series, 100).
Amazing... You can see the IO ports and Memory Map in PCH spec, it gives an
totally understanding of such stuff.

Last again.

Intel integrated graphics controller: works like normal GPU, and lay in the
same die with cpu cores, frontend -- Execution Unit -- backend, frontend can
been seen as instruction fetch and data detch, execution unit is the core part,
backend is responsible for format and decode data into different signals to
DVI or HDMI.

Integrated graphic controller(or driver) can work together with external GPU
card from Nvdia, and yes, multiple screen output. It is unbelieveable that
intel has done such a great job! I have to say the integrated graphic is very
beautiful.

Fun journey, is it?
