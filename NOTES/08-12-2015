Core is different from Xeon.
Core i3 processor has Display Interface(eg.HDMI), but Xeon does not.
VGA is supported from PCH. Processor has Flexible Display Interface connected to
PCH, which, provide legacy VGA support.

Signal layout in LGA1150 is described in datasheet-vol-1, we can see how these
signals are spreaded in such a small chip.

Fun journey, is it?
