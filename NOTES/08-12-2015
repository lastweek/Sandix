# Keyword: Core, Display Interface, VGA, LGA 1150

Core is different from Xeon.
Core i3 processor has Display Interface(eg.HDMI), but Xeon does not.
That is because Core is dedicated for Desktop which need visual display. At the
oppsite, Xeon is dedicated for Server which need more calculation than display.

VGA is supported by PCH. Processor has Flexible Display Interface connected to
PCH, which, provide legacy VGA support.

See? VGA is almost obsolete. New CPU prefer HDMI and DVI and BlueRay.

Signal layout in LGA 1150 is described in datasheet-vol-1, we can see how these
signals are spreaded in such a small chip. Also i have downloaded a LGA 1150
specification from Intel.com which has a descriptive portray about 1150.

Fun journey, is it?
