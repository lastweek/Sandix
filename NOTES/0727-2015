Today i am implementing VT and VGA console.
Finally, i knew hwo VT works, and what's the relationship bewtween VT&VC and
VGA console.

The VGA console(drivers/video/vgacon.c) implement some basic cursor movement,
screen output functions. And his upper layer, the VT&VC, is resiponsible for
intepretting different actions like escape sequence, and controlling the output
actions.

Oh, btw, the ASICC Escape Sequence is very interesting! And it will be
implemented in VT&VC layer(drivers/tty/vt.c).

When there two layers are done, we will head to TTY layer and Line Disipline.
