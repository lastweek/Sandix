# Keyword: PCI, Intel CPU integrated PCI devices, Memory Hole

ANOTHER PCI DAY.
FINALLY, i figure out how the PCI devices in Intel CPU works.
Those PCI devices including Host Bridge, IMC, IGC, QPI...

Yes, many components resides on PCI as a virtual device in CPU.
Yes, CPU can access these virtual device through Type0 configuration method.

Yes, some virtual devices like host bridge(Device 0, Function 0) control how
memory address space is divided into different devices. For example, decide
map legacy 0xA0000~0xBFFFF to Intel Integrated Graphic Controller(Device 1).

Yes, these virtual devices along with others who reside on PCH, control the
memory address map and IO ports map. And that is why main memory address space
has so many _holes_!! Coz some many memory areas are mapped into VGA, PCI!!!

Yes, of course, the configuration space registers of these virtual devices are
initialized by UEFI/BIOS. Operating System _should_ _not_ touch these things.

Yes, of course. Operating System _can_ modify these configurations. Such as OS
can let Host Bridge do not map 0xF00000~0x1000000 to ISA hole, just let this
area map to DRAM. OS can do this, but no OS will do this. But as a beginner, i
should do this!
