# Keyword: ieee802

Yes, these days i've been reading <Computer Networks>. After reading the
physical layer and data link layer(MAC+LLC) chapters, i chose to read ieee802
specs. Wow, those specs are huge. But they are nice reading books.

Tomorrow i will go back to Beijing. The 15-days suspension is going to end! And
the development of Sandix kernel is going to restart!
