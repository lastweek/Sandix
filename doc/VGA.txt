This days i've been reading materail about Graphic Cards, especially VGA.
When in Real Address Mode, we can use BIOS [int 0x10] to control VGA's output,
however, we can not call BIOS anymore when we turn to Protected Mode.

Therefore, we have to build our own driver to control VGA. The driver is similar to
[int 0x10]. We use IO-port & Memory-Mapped region to communicate with VGA. There are 
same open-souce VGA drivers i've downloaded, which can be a good template for me.
