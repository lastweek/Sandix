I am not kidding. The right thing i need to do is coding a runnable OS.
At the very start, i will figure out how OS boot from UEFI(or Legacy BIOS).

Here is my plan for 2014-12:
1.	Read UEFI manual, figure out how UEFI control hardware and firmware,
	what interfaces UEFI will give to os loader.
2.	Learn GPT which is created to substitute for MBR. Also, if possible,
	choose a proper file system from Ext2 or FAT or HFS.
3.	Learn device drives.
4.	After all, implement with USB memory stick!
5.	GOOD LUCK!
