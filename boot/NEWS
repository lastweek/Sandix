Call C functions from assemble is a little tricky.
As designs, the bootsect do not need link. but header.s, main.c and so on need to
be linked together to form the real-mode kernel image. Because the link process
is done under 16-bit mode, maybe it's a little different from 32-bit linking.

Tonight i tried to link header.o and main.o together with some difficult. So, in
my opinion, i should try to learn ld scripts to get things done more efficency.
