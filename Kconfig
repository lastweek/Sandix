menu	"Processor type and features"

config	SMP
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"
	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, say N. If you have a system with more
	  than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on uni- and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  uniprocessor machines. On a uniprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  Note that if you say Y here and choose architecture "586" or
	  "Pentium" under "Processor family", the kernel will not work on 486
	  architectures. Similarly, multiprocessor kernels for the "PPro"
	  architecture may not work on all Pentium based boards.

	  People using multiprocessor machines who say Y here should also say
	  Y to "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support", below. The "Advanced Power
	  Management" code will be disabled if you say Y here.

	  See also <file:Documentation/x86/i386/IO-APIC.txt>,
	  <file:Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt> and the SMP-HOWTO available at
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

	  This enables support for debugging spinlocks. If you want to debug
	  spinlocks, say Y.
