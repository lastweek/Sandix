When i really turn to PM kernel, i find there are many difficults
before coding PM. I should have planned what to do first, the task?
the filesystem?...

I have to say now we have all the resources and freedom to do everything
we want. Now we have 32-bit CPU, boot_params, and so on.

Maybe we can start by traps and interrupts, like keyboard and timer. After that
we can build task and filesystem?
