Some advice about IO programming and the usage of IO delay:

If one wishes to be extra cautious when writing to registers, after writing to a register one can read the value back and compare it with 
the original value. If they differ it may mean that the VGA hardware has a stuck bit in one its registers, that you are attempting to 
modify a locked or unsupported register, or that you are not providing enough delay between I/O accesses. As long as reading the register 
twice doesn't have any unintended side effects, when reading a registers value, one can read the register twice and compare the values 
read, after masking out any fields that may change without CPU intervention. If the values read back are different it may mean that you 
are not providing enough delay between I/O accesses, that the hardware is malfunctioning, or are reading the wrong register or field. 
Other problems that these techniques can address are noise on the I/O bus due to faulty hardware, dirty contacts, or even sunspots! When 
perform I/O operations and these checks fail, try repeating the operation, possibly with increased I/O delay time. By providing extra 
robustness, I have found that my own programs will work properly on hardware that causes less robust programs to fail.
