# Keyword: Comments of code

Why this topic?
Okay, i have not coding sandix for about 15 days, and when i looking into the
TTY driver code, i find that some code is a little confused for me. Thanks to
the comments i writtern before, they help me understand what i tried to do
before.

Writing good comments always help! Now or future, myself or others!
