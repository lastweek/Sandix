# Keyword: Datacenter, NIC

Still, I am reading papers about datacenter architecture. Those papers were
published early, about 2008~2013. It is interesting. Building datacenter is not
an easy job, but still compelling :-)

Another topic: NIC
Today, I dig into the NIC and its corresponding drivers. Huh.. It is amazing!
It is hard to image how complex the NIC is! The Intel Ethernet Datasheet
describes the details inside NIC! It is about block-level, low-level function
capacity, and everything about NIC! Besides, I read the NIC driver code inside
Linux, it is under drivers/net/ directory. Each vendor has his subdirectory.

Anyway, this material helps me building the hardware understanding about low
level NIC, it also gives me a better understanding about the linux net layer
abstraction and PCI device abstraction.


Aha, I can not wait to build the TCP/IP stack, net subsystem and related things
of Sandix!
