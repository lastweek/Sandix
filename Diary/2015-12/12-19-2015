# Keyword: Heterogeneous

Hmm, today I have read IEEE Micro 2015-Issue-5, about heterogeneous computing.
I have touched this topic ago, about heterogeneous ISA, heterogeneous CMP...
Especially, some papers from Deam Tusllen (UCSD), who has did numerous work
about heterogeneous things...

"Heterogeneous Processors" has two types:
	1) A processor that includes two or more computing cores that rely on
	   the same instruction-set architecture (ISA) but are microarchitecturelly
	   different. For example, a processor that includes two MIPS ISA cores,
	   one OOO 4-wat superscaler core, and one more simplistic in-order core.
	
	2) The second type of heterogeneous processor comprises multicore chips
	   based on two or more different ISAs - For example, a processor that
	   includes one MIPS computing core and one ARM-based computing core.
	   The IBM Cell processor is an actual case of such a heterogeneous
	   processor, as is ARMâ€™s big.LITTLE.
