# Keyword: 3D, NUCA

These days, I have read numerous papers about 3D-stacking. This technology
starts from near 2004, especially a published paper by Intel, describing a
3D-stacked IA32 processor. Then after 2004, there are so much effors paied
from academic and industry. Particularily, in 2005 and 2006, there were some
papers published in asplos and isca.

There are three eminent 3D-stacking researchers: Gariel H. Loh, Yuan Xie, and
Bryan Black. They published a survey essay in IEEE Micro May-June 2007, which
is a very good paper.

So, does 3D really impacts our mainstream processors? For now, I am not sure.
It seems there are some 3D-FPGAs from Xilinx and Altera. U of Rochester and
some groups have created some prototypes. AMD says they have some. BTW, Black
now is in AMD.

I think I have read enough about 3D-stacking. I am not gonna investigate into
the circuit level, I just focus on the microarchitecture, cache, dram modifications.
Things are pretty normal.

Fine, after this, I gonna do some research about Non-Uniform Cache Architecture,
and Alpha processor microarchitecture. About NUCA, there some pretty nice papers.
The one I have read before is a paper published in ISCA09. About Alpha, I always
planning to read about it. So many researchers say it was very incrediable in
microarchitecture design. It failed because of market policy. Anyway, focus on
the technology first!
