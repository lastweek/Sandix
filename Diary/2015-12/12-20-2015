# Keyword: Accelerator

Hmm. Accelerators have drawed hugh attention these years. Those accelerators
would be integrated into the SoC with CPU core. Mainly, they intend to boost
specific applications's performance, like ML, Video encode/decode, Security.

This is a very hot topic in top conferences. Similar to yesterday's topic --- 
heterogeneous computing, accelerators is just a specific application of
heterogeneous computing, right? So, sometimes, ideas are all the same. All we
need is apply those ideas to each different areas.

# Keyword: Multicore

Multicore Multicore, a simple concept that everybody knows. But, how many
people really understand how Multicore works? How to design a Multicore?
-.- I am reading Micro 2015-Issue-5 Alternative Computing Technoligies, most of
its articles are talking about future computing architecture. They are all
talking about Multicore and CMP, and how it would be inefficient in the future.
They all proposed new solutions or techonoligies to address these problems.
BUT, are they all feasible? Sign. In my opinion, most of them are just academic
toys. Sometimes, as a researcher, you have to distinguish if a paper really
worth reading, or if the idea expressed from the paper really would have impacts.

Anyway, I should read more articles to expand my horizon, dig into some papers to
improve my really abilities. :-) Good luck, lastweek.

# Keyword: Address Space

Hmm, revisit this concept. Read various Intel CPU datasheets, see how it describes
the "Physical Address Space" and "DRAM Address Space".
CPU Datasheet:		Xeon, Core, Atom
Chipset Datasheet:	....
You will find that Atom is a SoC, it has integrated many features found in normal
chipset. Just like various ARM-based SoC, Atom processor is an Intel-based SoC.

Check Atom C2xx0 serious highly-integrated SoC! Especially, I would recommend:
	"atom-c2000-microserver-datasheet", it looks like an integrated version
	of a "CPU Datasheet" and a "Chipset Datasheet".

Good luck
