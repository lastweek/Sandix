Honestly, today, I have done nothing. It is annoying!!!! Sandix!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hmm. I just modified some codes of NVM emulator. I am gonna changing the emualtion
model, you know. I gonna use Home agents to sample LLC Read Miss and Remote requests.
It seems a good idea. But with various emulation restrictions, I do not think this
emulator is a good one.
