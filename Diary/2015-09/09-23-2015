# Keyword: Header File, Thread

As Sandix is growing big, the number code files and header files are becoming
large. It is worth to note about: Where to extern your global variable? We have
many global variables defined in C files, externed in header files. Normally,
the C file and header file have the same prefix, e.g. setup.c and setup.h
BUT, is that really reasonable to have corresponding header file forand every C ??
The answer is, NO! Why? Because we do not have so many header files!

If so, where to extern? You should rethink before you extern, why not other header
files? Choose a good place to extern, then when you are writing C code, you can
include proper header files, and do not need to search where you have externed.
