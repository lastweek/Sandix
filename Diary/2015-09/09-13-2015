# Keyword: Kconfig Kbuild

It is really hard but exciting.
I rewrote the Kbuild system and the most important thing is we have Kconfig now!
I create a Kconfig file in top directory, subsequent Kconfig files will be added.
Of course, the Kconfig programs are copied from linux directly, thanks!

Next move is separating x86 with the upper arch-independent code.
