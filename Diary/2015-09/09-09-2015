# Keyword: Crypto

Sorry, yesterday evening i spent some time reading Network Security along with
some crypto things like DES, AES, RSA... So i was thinking create crypto
subdirectory and learn those code from Linux. Yes Yes Yes, i barely need crpto
things. But it is always nice to learn new things. ;)
