More about tty. Some of them from [Linux device drivers].

The tty core is responsible for controlling both the flow of data across a
tty device and the format of the data. This allows tty drivers to focus on
handling the data to and from the hardware, instead of worrying about how
to control the interaction with user space in a consistent way. To control
the flow of data, there are a number of different line disciplines that can
be virtually "plugged" into any tty device. This is donw by different tty
line discipline drivers.

There are three different types of tty drivers: console, serial port and pty.
Console drivers communicate with the screen and input keyboard. Serial port
drivers communicate with the serial port such as RS232. PTY drivers consists
of master and slave part.

In Sandix, there is only one tty driver available: console drivers. This tty
driver control the screen output and receive characters from keyboard. Just
a note, the underlying screen output also has a additional abstraction. Since
we may have VGA screen or MDA screen or others. That is why we have *driver_data
field in tty_struct: Make tty drivers more general, to have another abstraction.
