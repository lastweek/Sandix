# Keyword: include in Makefile, include/config/* include/generated/*

It is important to know how Makefiles are remade and how 'include'
directive works. Here are some words form GNU Make Manual:

If a Makefile can be remade from other files, you probably want make to
get an up-to-date version of the Makefile to read in. After reading in all
Makefiles, make will consider each as a goal target and attempt to update
it. If a Makefile has a rule which says how to update it(found either in
that very Makefile or in other one) or if an implicit rule applies to it,
it will be updated if necessary. After all Makefiles have been checked, if
any have actually been changed, make starts with a clean slate and reads all
the Makefiles again.

If you know that one or more of your Makefiles can NOT be remade and you want
to keep make from performing an implicit rule search on them, perhaps for
effiency reasons, you can use any normal method of preventing implicit rule
look-up to do so. For example, you can write an explicit rule wuth the
Makefile as the target, and an empty recipe.

'-q' and '-n' do not prevent updating of Makefiles, because an out-of-date
Makefile would result in the wrong output for other targets.

OK, now let us talk about Kconfig with his --silentoldconfig.
Kconfig read auto.conf and make two new directories: include/config and
include/generated. The first one include/config is used by fixdep.c to use
a clever trick! Another one is used to store autoconf.h which all source files
included, and some version files.

So in Linux kernel, Kconfig and fixdep.c works together. I mimic everything,
actually, i do nothing. The only work i do is copying. ;)
