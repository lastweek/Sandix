Hmm, my TOEFL failed again, only 90 scores.
I have to retake it at Nov 21, 8 days later. For Duke!

In the meantime, i have to finish the page migration code. This one looks
simple, but i think it would be a little tricky.

Wish myself luck.


Oh, by the way, i reread the "White Deer Plain" again yesterday. I am really
looking forward for the TV version!
