# Keywords: Books, Consistency, Coherence

Long time no see baby.
I'm adding two [barrier] header files yesterday, and it reminds me something
about cache coherence and memory consistency. Sign, I've read this topic a lot
times but I still do not get a very good understanding of them.

The reality is that sometimes I do *not* know at where that I should put smp_mb().
Of course I can mimic Linux, and I want to learn myself.

So I decide to pick up this topic (coherence/consistency) again and read some books
and papers to try to have a better understanding.

I will re-read computer architecture book first
and then I will read <<A_Primer_on_Memory_Consistency_and_Coherence>>
