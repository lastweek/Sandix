# Keyword: Kbuild

What the fuck.
Rewriting Makefiles and trying to build Kbuild system based on Linux.
The organization of Makefile is really bad, makes my eye hurt. ;(

So actually, what is new?
1) Support build in external directory. e.g. make O=/foo/bar
2) Support Sparse checker. e.g. make C=1, make C=2
3) Support Very Verbose build. e.g. make V=2
4) Support architecture specific build. Ofcourse, x86 only.
5) Support kernel config. e.g. make config, make menuconfig
6) Various new scripts. e.g. scripts/basic/fixdep.c
7) New link-vmSandix method. The previous one is too ugly.
6) Reorganization. Cleaner and easier to read.
