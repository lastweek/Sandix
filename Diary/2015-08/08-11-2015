Aha. Mark today!
So... Today i bought a motherboard(B85) and a i3-4150(LGA1150). And also, i
spent whole day reading and learning about motherboard and PCH. Now i got a more
clear view about cpu, northbridge, southbridge, PCH, motherboard than before!
With current Intel CPU, there is no more northbridge anymore. CPU now has a
"integrated" northbridge, and all the other things are in PCH.

Note that Intel B85 Datasheet has saied how B85 support legacy 8253, 8259 and so on.

Whatever, now i have a better understanding about how computer works!!!
