# Keyword: 0x100000 0xC0000000

These days i've been modifing bootloader.S

The big news is now loader will load kernel to 0x100000 instead 0x10000.
Normally, BIOS INT 0x13 load kernel to 0x1000:0000, after that, manually
copy kernel from 0x10000 to 0x100000. Subsequently, modified pm.c and
pmjump.S of setup to jump to 0x100000, too.

Another big news is linking kernel from 0xC0000000+0x100000. So everything
starts from head.S have to fit with this new virtual address. The most urgent
is changing paging. Without proper paping, nothing can go further.
