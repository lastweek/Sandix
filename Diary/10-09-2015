# Keyword:  Coding Style

Advices from <The Art of Readable Code>:


	Part I: Surface-Level Improvements
Simple ways to improve the readability of your code.

1) Packing information into names
	
	... Use longer names for larger scopes
	... Avoid generic names (e.g. tmp, retval)
	... Attach important details (e.g. ms, ns...)
	... Use capitalization, underscore and so on in a meaningful way!

2) Making names more understandable
	
	The person reading your code will understand it the way you meant it.
	Before you decide on a name, imagine how your name might be
	misunderstood, the best names are resistant to misinterpretation.

	... Use is_ has_ to make boolean clear
	... Max and Min
	... First and Last
	... Begin and End

3) Aesthetics

	Good source code should be just as "easy on the eyes".

	... Consistent style is more important than the "right" style
	... Make similar code look similar
	... Group related lines of code into blocks
	... Spacing!
	... Alignment!
	... Ordering!
	... Consistent!

4) Comment

	What to comment
	What NOT to comment
	Put yourself in the reader's shoes

	... Do NOT comment on facts that can be derived quickly from the code
	... Using TODO FIXME HACK XXX
	... Comment on your constants! (That is pretty important)
	... A few well-chosen sentences are better than nothing at all.
	... Describe a function's behaviour with as much precise as is pratical
	... State the high level intent of your code
	... Keep your comments brief by using words that pack a lot of meaning.
	... Precise!
	... Brevity!
	... DO IT!


	Part II: Simplifying Loops and Logic

1) Making Control Flow Easy to Read

	Yes, i trying to write better code, better control flow!!!

	... Make all your conditionals, loops, and other changes to control
	    flow as "natual" as possible - written in a way that doesn't make
	    the reader stop and reread you code.
	... Instead of minimizing the number of lines, a better metric is to
	    minimize the time needed for someone to understand it.

	... Returning early from a function
	... Using GOTO properly

2) Breaking down giant expressions

	... Break down your giant expressions into more digestible pieces
	... Using "explaining variable" e.g. [head]=&foo->list; 
	... Using "summary variable"

3) Variables

	... Eliminate variables that just get in the way. Eliminate
	    "intermediate result" variables by handling the result immediately.
	... Reduce the scope of each variable to be as small as possible. Move
	    each variable to a place where the fewest lines of code can see it.
	    Out of sight is out of mind.
	... Prefer write-once variables. Variables that are set only once
	    (or const) make code easier to understand.


	Part III: Reorganizing your code

1) Extracting Unrelated Problems
	
	A simple way to think about this chapter is to separate the generic
	code from the project-specific code. As it turns out, most code is
	generic. By building a large set of libraries and helper functions to
	solve the general problems, what’s left will be a small core of what
	makes your program unique.
	
	The main reason this technique helps is that it lets the programmer
	focus on smaller, well-defined problems that are detached from the rest
	of your project. As a result, the solutions to those subproblems tend
	to be more thorough and correct. You might be able to reuse them later.

2) One Task At a Time

	Breaking a large function into multiple smaller functions can be good.
	But even if you don’t do this, you can still organize the code inside
	that large function so it feels like there are separate logical sections.
