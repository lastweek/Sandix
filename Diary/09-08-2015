# Keyword: Internet

Get up early(6:30 AM) and continue reading <Computer Networks> chapter 5
which is The Network Layer. What do i got? Fist of all, distinguish the
concept of Network and Internet and intenet. The book's name is Computer
Networks, not Computer Internet. Internet can be defined: network of networks.
internet can been seen as an abjective. Second, there some different network
layers, such as IPX, AppleTalk and IP. The Internet use IP as its network layer
protocol(along with ARP, ICMP etc.). As we know, the Internet is dominate the
world, IP is almost everywhere, so we should concern about other network layer
protocols? It is because ISP use some different network layer protocols in
their internal networks(which leads to multiprotocol router).

Although the world in dominated by TCP/IP which is the base of the Internet, we
should still, at least, know the other network layer protocols!(Of course, you
can find net/appletalk driver in linux kernel!)

BTW, read some RFC and pay attention to IANA and IETF.

That is all.
