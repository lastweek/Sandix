Yes, everythins was done!!!!!!!!
Now I am waiting if someone could offer me an offer - -- - - - - -- - -

Also I am not actively writing code these days, but I have read numerous papers.
I think I should read all ASPLOS, ISCA, OSDI, SOSP MICRO papers published after 1990.
Some classic architecture papers were published before 1990, I could find them
out at the references of newly published ones.

Besides, some transactions and journals of ACM and IEEE are pretty good. I would
read them at spare time.

Hmm. Computer Science is really charming, right? :)

Hmm. I have not touched Sandix for a loooooong time. But I have never forgot it!
I have a plan about the next steps:

	0) Some header files, some libraries				(Urge)
	1) First of all, using E820 table to build the memory map	(Urge)
	2) Maybe build the memory management layer			(Optional)
	3) Build the task_struct, some process facilities.		(Urge)
	4) Interrupt Subsystem						(Urge)
	5) Some syscall							(Optional)
	6) IO Management						(Urge)
	6) VFS + FS(Ext2) + Block Layer + Driver			(Urge)
	7) PCIe subsystem						(Urge)

	0) REMEMBER! KEEP THAT IN MIND!
