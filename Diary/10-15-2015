# Keyword: Apache, JS+jQuery, Paper!

Spend some time learning CSS+HTML5+JS. I have coded JSP in three years ago on a
class project. Back to the old days, i did not have a good understanding of
how web works, making JSP website was a pretty vague process. The qiuqiuxu.com
and ali cloud server motivated me to develop a personal website, so i decided
to learn these things well. CSS HTML JS are simple, it is easy to understand
and learn. It is later, i am pretty tired... I have download Apache httpd
source code 5 mins ago. It is written in C! Not Java! What a surprise.

So i have another project to learn: Apache web server! I can port it to Sandix.

Oh, last few words about paper. Today i found one ISCA2015 papar about Hardware
transactional memory performance evaluation. It is my first time to find a paper
doing this reseach. Read it tomorrow. Good night.
