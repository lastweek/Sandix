Today, I revisited the NVM emulator. During this process, I gained a deeper
understanding about memory hiearachy. Caching agent, ring inconnect, home agent,
and IMC, all of these together formed an integrated view of the processor's
memory system. Especially, I learned how important Cbox and HA are! Also, what
roles they are playing in the processor! HA and Cbox are just beautiful abstractions
among core, cache, memory. They keep the consistency and coherence between
on-chip cores and remote sockets. Interestingly, in the morning, I read a paper
talking about "coherence NoC inteconnect", and I really did not understand it well,
especially the interconnect. Bon! This afternoon, I digged into the Intel's ring.
And Bon again! I learned something and know what the paper is talking about. haha.
