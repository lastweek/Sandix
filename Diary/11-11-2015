# Keyword: SoC, Processor

Hmm, i finished book: "Computer System Design: System-on-Chip". Of course, I
did not read all chapters, since some chapters and aspects are still too hard
for me. OK, let me talk about what I have learnd from this book:

	1) Currently, SoC designers will not need to design CPU, they can just
	   use ARM, MicroBlaze, NIOS2 or else. That means, CPU is avaliable all
	   the time, what designers need to do is customizing the general CPU
	   and the peripheral IPs for their products.

	2) Designing a Sysem-on-Chip is very challenging. Designers have to
	   consider: chip area, layout, performance, finance and so on. Of
	   course, such a designer has to have all relevant knowledge and
	   skills!


Ohh, BTW, yesterday i downloaded the OpenSPARC T1 source code! It is written by
Verilog! T1 is a 8-core, 64-bit processor, based on UltraSPARC which is RISC.
Thanks to Sun Corp. to open source this great project, we students can have a
chance to read the real Processor Verilog Code! How I wish I can meet this one
two years ago.

Now i have learned and used: Intel x86, ARM(ARMv8), SPARC!
