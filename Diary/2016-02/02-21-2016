# Keyword: Accelerator

So, I am reading the first ISCA. Some papers are pretty interesting, and are
related to some fashion things nowadays. Come on, we are talking about 1973.
Intel released 4004 at 1974.

After reading these old papers, I realized the importance of circuit like
vaccum, electronic tube, transistor and Integrated Circuits, Large Scale Integration,
Very LSC. Without the improvements of physical circuits, no modern computer
systems would exist any more.

1)
ISCA, 1973, "Implementation aspects of the SYMBOL hardware compiler"

This might be the first hardware accelerator I've ever seen. It is a compiler
implemented totally in hardware. Interesting.

2)
ISCA, 1973, "The architecture of CASSM: A cellular system for non-numeric processing"

This paper describes a hardware accelerator system for non-numeric processing.
The most important things is: it talks about "relational database". And its
references including the earliest papar about datebase:
	"A relational model of data for large shared data banks" of Dr. Codd
