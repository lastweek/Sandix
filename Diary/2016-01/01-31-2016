1) SX-ACE from NEC, a memory insentive, vector CPU. It has 16 MC, BW=256 GB/s
   It is a dedicated processor for datacenter. People are trying to customize
   specific processors for datacenter workload's requirement

   Need to mention that it has a variable cacheline size. DRAN power depends on
   the size of cacheline. Anyway, this is my first time heard about this.

2) SPARC64 from Fujitsu
   It mentions some RAS features, which are pretty interesting.
   So what is the difference between SPARC and SPARC64? Only Japanese companies
   are shipping sparc processors now?

3) Anton2. A molecular processor. ...
   It must be a big project. From the CPU to system software to compiler to
   biology software. It is a real all-layer co-design.
