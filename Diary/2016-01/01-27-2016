# Keyword: Intel physcical address space

1)
In protected mode, the IA-32 architecture provides a normal physical address
space of 4 GBytes (2^32 bytes). This is the address space that the processor
can address on its address bus. This address space is flat (unsegmented), with
addresses ranging continuously from 0 to FFFF_FFFFH. This physical address space
can be mapped to read-write memory, read-only memory, and memory mapped I/O.

Starting with the Pentium Pro processor, the IA-32 architecture also supports
an extension of the physical address space to 2^36 bytes (64 GBytes); with a
maximum physical address of F_FFFF_FFFFH. This extension is invoked in either
of two ways:
 • Using the physical address extension (PAE) flag, located in bit 5 of control register CR4.
 • Using the 36-bit page size extension (PSE-36) feature (introduced in the Pentium III processors).

2)
On processors that support Intel 64 architecture (CPUID.80000001H:EDX[29] = 1),
the size of the physical address range is implementation-specific and indicated
by CPUID.80000008H:EAX[bits 7-0].
